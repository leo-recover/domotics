# domotics
A simple domotics system using Raspberry-Pi, several smart nodes, and radio modules.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
Currently domotics is still WIP. This means that it's not working. Specifically:
-   HW project is OK, meaning that it can be used as a development board for this (or other) project
-   FW project is the under development, but not working
-   SW project is not started yet
